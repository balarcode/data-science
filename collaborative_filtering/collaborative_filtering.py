# Title     : Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
# Author    : balarcode
# Version   : 1.0
# Date      : 30th January 2025
# File Type : Python Script / Program
# File Test : Verified on Python 3.12.6
# Comments  : Collaborative filtering algorithm is used for Recommender Systems. The algorithm
#             learns about the ratings provided for items by users to predict a rating for a
#             new user who uses the same set of items from the catalogue. The items can include
#             a catalogue of movies, apparels, food, etc.
#             Multiple users contribute via collaboration in building a recommender system. By
#             learning from this built system, prediction or inference can be made on how new
#             users could rate the same items and thereby recommending the highly rated items
#             as a recommendation to the new users.
#             Prediction of a rating for a new user, j for a new item, i is given by:
#               w(j) . x(i) + b(j)
#             where, w(j) and b(j) are parameters learnt by fitting a regularized regression
#             model for all valid ratings provided by n_u number of users.
#             where, x(i) is the feature vector for every item, i learnt by fitting a regularized
#             regression model for all valid ratings received for n_i number of items.
#             In summary, parameters w(j), b(j) and x(i) for j = 1 to n_u and i = 1 to n_i that
#             minimize the cost function is learnt by the collaborative filtering algorithm before
#             making newer predictions or inferences.
