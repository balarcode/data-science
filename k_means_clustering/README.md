## K-Means Clustering Algorithm

K-means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It aims to parition a dataset of 'N' datapoints into respective 'k' clusters. For a datapoint to be placed in a cluster, it's squared Euclidean distance from the cluster centroid should be minimum. Cluster centroid is also the cluster mean and hence squared Euclidean distance becomes variance of the datapoints grouped within a cluster. The goal is to minimize this variance until convergence is achieved.
