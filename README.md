# data-science

Practical implementation of selected algorithms, concepts and techniques from data science, data analysis, data characterization and data visualization topics.

## Topics

### Anomaly Detection Algorithm

### Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

### Decision Tree Learning Algorithm

### K-Means Clustering Algorithm

### K-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm

### Linear Regression using Gradient Descent Algorithm

### Regularized Logistic Regression Algorithm

### Principal Component Analysis Algorithm

## Concepts

### Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of a dataset. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally performed during the data preprocessing step. Implementation of two of the feature scaling methods, mean normalization and standardization of a dataset can be understood [here](https://github.com/balarcode/subjects/tree/main/random_process#readme).
